Insights ●​ Even on a tiny dataset, the perceptron learning rule drives
the line toward the correct decision boundary. ●​ Recording every update
lets you visualize convergence, reinforcing how simple weight tweaks
reposition the line. ●​ This animation makes the “black‐box” of training
weights much more intuitive.
